# Cohesion Validation (All Levels)

## Project Context Detection ✅

- ✅ **Project level confirmed** - Level 2 (Small complete system)
- ✅ **Field type identified** - Greenfield
- ✅ **Appropriate sections applied** - Greenfield-specific validation performed

---

## Section A: Tech Spec Validation ⏸️ DEFERRED

**Status:** N/A - Tech spec will be generated by solutioning workflow

This is expected for Level 2 projects. Solutioning workflow will produce:
- solution-architecture.md
- Per-epic tech specs

Tech spec validation will occur after solutioning phase.

---

## Section B: Greenfield-Specific Validation ✅ PASS

### B.1 Project Setup Sequencing ✅

- ✅ **Project initialization in Epic 1** - Story 1.1 handles prerequisite detection and installation
- ✅ **Repository setup implicit** - Tool assumes cloning team's zsh-config repository (per user journey)
- ✅ **Development environment early** - Story 1.3 installs team-standard configuration
- ✅ **Core dependencies before use** - Story 1.1 installs Homebrew, git before proceeding
- ⚠️ **Testing infrastructure** - Not explicitly in epic structure; should be addressed in solutioning

**Minor Recommendation:** Add explicit story for repository/project structure setup in Epic 1 or clarify in solutioning phase.

### B.2 Infrastructure Before Features ✅

- ✅ **No database needed** - File-based configuration tool
- ✅ **No API framework needed** - CLI tool, not web service
- ✅ **No authentication needed** - Uses git's existing authentication
- ✅ **CI/CD mentioned** - In Phase 2 of Next Steps
- ✅ **Monitoring appropriate** - CLI tool doesn't require runtime monitoring

**Assessment:** Infrastructure needs minimal for CLI tool; appropriate sequencing in place.

### B.3 External Dependencies ✅

- ✅ **Third-party accounts** - Git hosting assumed already available (team repository)
- ⚠️ **API keys** - Not applicable unless remote backup (FR005) uses cloud storage
- ✅ **Credential storage** - NFR004 explicitly addresses: respect existing SSH/credential config
- ✅ **External service setup** - Plugin/theme sources assumed publicly accessible
- ✅ **Fallback strategies** - NFR002 requires rollback capability

**Minor Recommendation:** Clarify in solutioning whether FR005 "remote storage" requires cloud credentials or uses git remotes only.

---

## Section D: Feature Sequencing ✅ PASS

### D.1 Functional Dependencies ✅

- ✅ **Correct sequencing** - Epic 1 (Installation) → Epic 2 (Maintenance)
- ✅ **Shared components first** - Story 1.1 (Prerequisites) before 1.3 (Configuration)
- ✅ **User flows logical** - Install → Configure → Maintain
- ✅ **No authentication issue** - Tool respects existing git auth (NFR004)

**Epic 1 Story Sequencing:**
1. Prerequisite detection (Story 1.1) ✅
2. Backup existing config (Story 1.2) ✅
3. Install team config (Story 1.3) ✅
4. Plugin management (Story 1.4) ✅
5. Theme installation (Story 1.5) ✅
6. Personal customization (Story 1.6) ✅
7. Verification (Story 1.7) ✅

**Epic 2 Dependency on Epic 1:** ✅
- Self-update (2.1) requires working installation (1.x)
- Plugin updates (2.2) requires plugin system (1.4)
- Backup management (2.3) requires installed config (1.3)
- Restore (2.4) requires backup capability (1.2, 2.3)
- Git integration (2.5) requires dotfiles in place (1.3, 1.6)

### D.2 Technical Dependencies ✅

- ✅ **Lower-level before higher-level** - Homebrew → zsh → plugins → themes
- ✅ **Utilities before use** - Backup mechanism (1.2) before configuration changes (1.3)
- ✅ **Data models implicit** - Configuration files defined before manipulation
- ✅ **No API endpoints** - CLI tool, not applicable

### D.3 Epic Dependencies ✅

- ✅ **Epic 2 builds on Epic 1** - Maintenance requires installation foundation
- ✅ **No circular dependencies** - Clean Epic 1 → Epic 2 progression
- ✅ **Infrastructure reused** - Epic 2 leverages Epic 1's configuration system
- ✅ **Incremental value** - Epic 1 MVP delivers core value, Epic 2 enhances

**Phasing Assessment:** Epic 1 can be released independently as MVP; Epic 2 adds lifecycle management. Strong incremental value delivery.

## Section E: UI/UX Cohesion ⏸️ PARTIAL (CLI Tool)

### E.1 Design System (Greenfield) ⚠️ PARTIAL

- ⏸️ **No UI framework** - CLI tool, not applicable
- ⏸️ **No design system** - CLI tool, not applicable
- ✅ **Styling approach defined** - UX Principle 2: Clear feedback with progress indicators
- ⏸️ **Responsive design** - Not applicable for CLI
- ✅ **Accessibility** - CLI inherits terminal accessibility features

**Assessment:** Limited applicability for CLI tool. UX principles cover CLI-specific concerns (feedback, discoverability, error messages).

### E.2 Design Consistency (Brownfield) N/A

- N/A **Greenfield project** - No existing UI to match

### E.3 UX Flow Validation ✅

- ✅ **User journeys mapped** - Complete onboarding journey documented
- ✅ **Navigation patterns** - CLI commands (implied, will be defined in tech spec)

- ✅ **Loading states** - UX Principle 2: clear progress indicators

**Assessment:** Appropriate UX planning for CLI tool.

---

## Section F: Responsibility Assignment ✅ PASS

### F.1 User vs Agent Clarity ✅

- ✅ **Human-only tasks assigned** - User clones repository (per journey), user runs commands
- ✅ **No external accounts needed** - Uses existing git hosting, no new services
- ✅ **No payment actions** - Internal team tool
- ✅ **All code tasks → developer** - Implementation clearly developer responsibility
- ✅ **Configuration management** - Tool manages configs; users run tool

**Clear Responsibilities:**
- **User:** Clone repository, run installation command, provide team repository access
- **Developer/Agent:** Implement all 12 stories, create tool functionality
- **Tool (once built):** Automated installation, configuration, maintenance

---

## Section G: Documentation Readiness ✅ PASS

### G.1 Developer Documentation ✅

- ✅ **Setup instructions needed** - Implied in Next Steps Phase 2
- ✅ **Technical decisions documented** - Will be in solution-architecture.md from solutioning
- ✅ **Patterns and conventions** - Story 1.7 includes verification/summary
- ✅ **API documentation** - N/A for CLI tool (command documentation needed instead)

**Recommendation:** Solutioning phase should include:
- README for installation
- Command reference documentation
- Developer contribution guide
- Testing documentation

### G.2 Deployment Documentation (Brownfield) N/A

- N/A **Greenfield project** - No existing deployment to update

---

## Section H: Future-Proofing ✅ PASS

### H.1 Extensibility ✅

- ✅ **Current vs future clear** - Out of Scope section lists 10 future features
- ✅ **Architecture supports enhancements** - Plugin system (1.4) allows extensibility
- ✅ **Technical debt considerations** - Story 1.6 (personal customization) prevents team config lock-in
- ✅ **Extensibility points** - Plugin management, theme system, backup targets

**Identified Extensibility Points:**
- Plugin sources (currently curated list, could expand to custom registries)
- Theme options (currently approved themes, could add custom theme support)
- Backup destinations (local/remote, could add cloud sync)
- Supported shells (currently zsh, could add bash/fish)

### H.2 Observability ✅

- ✅ **Monitoring strategy** - CLI tool; logging/output appropriate
- ✅ **Success metrics captured** - Goals include measurable outcomes (< 10 min, consistency)
- ✅ **Analytics not needed** - Out of Scope: Usage Analytics (#7) appropriately excluded for MVP
- ✅ **Performance measurement** - NFR001 specifies < 5 minutes installation time

**Assessment:** Appropriate observability for CLI tool MVP. Usage tracking deferred to future.
