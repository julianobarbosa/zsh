---

## 4. Code vs Design Balance Analysis

### 4.1 Design-Appropriate Sections ✅

**Well-Balanced:**
- System Architecture (diagrams, component overview)
- Data Architecture (schemas, file formats)
- Function Interface Design (signatures, parameters)
- ADRs (rationale without implementation)
- Proposed Source Tree (structure without full code)

### 4.2 Code Examples - Acceptable Level ✅

**Found Code Snippets:**
1. Error handling pattern (12 lines) - ✅ Acceptable (pattern demonstration)
2. Config parsing examples (8 lines each) - ✅ Acceptable (interface examples)
3. Atomic write pattern (6 lines) - ✅ Acceptable (critical pattern)
4. Progress spinner (15 lines) - ⚠️ Borderline (could be reduced to signature)

**Assessment:** Code examples are design-level patterns, not full implementations. Acceptable for Level 2 architecture document.

**Recommendation:** In per-epic tech specs, ensure code examples remain < 10 lines or reference to implementation files.

### 4.3 Missing Implementations (Appropriate) ✅

**Correctly Omitted:**
- Full function bodies (deferred to implementation)
- Complete .zshrc templates (referenced, not inlined)
- Detailed parsing logic (described, not coded)
- Test suite implementations (structure defined only)

**Design Balance Score:** 95% design-focused (excellent)
