# Project Workflow Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Project:** zsh
**Analyst:** Barbosa

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** CLI/Shell Configuration Tool
- **Project Level:** Level 2 (Small complete system)
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-med.md

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** A comprehensive zsh configuration and maintenance system for macOS - greenfield development. The system will provide installation, dotfile management, plugin handling, theme support, backup/restore capabilities, and macOS-specific shell optimizations.
- **Estimated Stories:** 5-15 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 1-2 epics
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (single developer)

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Greenfield
- **Existing Documentation:** None
- **Team Size:** Solo developer / Small team
- **Deployment Intent:** Local installation, likely open-source distribution

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

1. **PRD.md** - Focused Product Requirements Document covering:
   - Executive summary and goals
   - User personas and use cases
   - Feature requirements
   - Success metrics
   - Technical constraints and assumptions

2. **tech-spec.md** - Technical specification including:
   - System architecture
   - Technology stack decisions
   - Implementation approach
   - File structure and module design
   - Testing strategy

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Discovery & Requirements** ✅ Complete
   - Created PRD.md with essential sections
   - Defined user needs and core features
   - Established success criteria

2. **Solution Design** ✅ Complete
   - Generated solution-architecture.md
   - Created per-epic technical specifications
   - Defined architecture and implementation plan

3. **Validation** ✅ Complete
   - Reviewed PRD against checklist (validation report)
   - Validated technical feasibility (cohesion check)
   - Confirmed scope and timeline

### Implementation Status

- [x] PRD generated and validated
- [x] Epic structure defined
- [x] Solution architecture generated
- [x] Cohesion check passed (98% ready)
- [x] Tech specs generated for all epics
- [ ] Repository setup pending
- [ ] Implementation phase pending

### Next Actions

1. Load instructions-med.md for Level 2 PRD creation
2. Begin PRD development focusing on:
   - Core use cases for zsh configuration/maintenance
   - macOS-specific requirements
   - Plugin and theme management needs
   - User experience for installation and updates

## Special Considerations

- **macOS Focus:** Must consider macOS-specific shell behaviors, Terminal.app vs iTerm2, system integrity protection
- **Dotfile Management:** Version control integration, backup/restore, migration from existing configs
- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Integration with Oh My Zsh, Prezto, or custom plugin management
- **Update Mechanism:** Self-update capability, dependency management
- **User Experience:** Both CLI power users and developers new to zsh customization

## Technical Preferences Captured

- Platform: macOS (primary target)
- Shell: zsh (primary technology)
- Project structure: TBD during PRD phase
- No specific preferences captured yet - will be defined during requirements gathering
